                            Author: Mike Shubic</h4>
                          <p class="card-text">In this article I feature my top-10 favorite Czech Republic road trip 
                            destinations, including distances from Prague, as well as hotel, restaurant and activity 
                            suggestions. This post is full of links to help your planning, including a road trip map 
                            at the bottom.
                            I have road tripped all over the Czech Republic (aka Czechia) during several visits. I 
                            had a tough time narrowing this list to just ten, so I may sneak in a couple of other 
                            nearby destinations not to miss.
                            
                            This central European country is not very large, as a matter of fact, most of these 
                            Czech Republic road trip suggestions are just around a 2 hour drive from the capital 
                            city of Prague (with exception to Ostrava, which is the furthest at around 3.5 hours).
                            
                            The Czech Republic is probably most well known for its opulent castles, classical 
                            music (and musical history), crystal glass, and its beer scene. Interesting fact; 
                            Czechs consume more beer per capital than any other country in the world.

                        <p class="card-text">The Czech Republic is a perfect destination for adventure. With loads of 
                          nature and fun outdoor activities on offer, you can easily escape into the wilderness.
                          One trip that brings back many great memories from my adventures across the Czech Republic 
                          has to be heading to South Bohemia, and exploring the riverways by river rafting.
                          
                          The Vltava River is the longest Czech river, running from Vyssi Brod down to Ceske 
                          Budejovice. The upper part of the river is around 50 miles long – perfect for 
                          exploring over a long weekend.
                          
                          Following this river route will take you through many small towns and large cities 
                          along the way. One part of the river takes you right through the middle of the 
                          historical town of Cesky Krumlov.
                          
                          Make sure you pack a tent – you will pass a few campsites along the way, and it’s a 
                          great opportunity to sleep under the stars.
                          
                          Also, you’ll want to visit the many Czech breweries you will pass along the route. 
                          Did you know that the Czech Republic has over 400 breweries?
                          
                          Many of these traditional breweries are to be found in South Bohemia, so you can 
                          easily combine your river rafting adventure with a beer trail and explore the 
                          gastronomical delights found along the waterway too.
                          
                          Now that sounds like my kind of trip!

                                    <p class="card-text">Easily, one of the most beautiful places in the Brno area is Moravian 
                                      Karst, protected nature reserve located near the town Blansko. When I was researching for 
                                      my upcoming Czech Republic trip last year, I came across Punkva Caves and Machocha Abyss, 
                                      both incredibly beautiful natural settings that I knew I had to visit.
                                      However, as always with less popular spots, there wasn’t much information about it and 
                                      how to get there from Prague, so I decided to write an article with all the important 
                                      information and tips I wish I found back then in one place. In this article, you will 
                                      find out how to reach Punkva Caves and Macocha Abyss from Prague and Brno, how to 
                                      book a cave tour and what to look out for during your visit.

                                    Czech Republic. Mostly known for its capital, Ceske Budejovice, and its great historic 
                                    town, Cesky Krumlov. However, it is also a horse riding paradise.
                                    The area provides glowing hills, full of grasslands, countrysides, and forests. 
                                    From riding a horse through beautiful countryside, you will pass picturesque 
                                    villages and get lost in beautiful pine forests. The area offers you everything 
                                    from horse riding experiences starting from an hour, till half day, full day and 
                                    even multiple trek day tours.

                              <p class="card-text">Traditional towns with charming squares, a long history of beer 
                                production, and stunning Baroque architecture are some of the things the Czech 
                                Republic is famous for. But what I remember the most from my trip to this beautiful 
                                country, are the fairy tale castles of South Bohemia.
                                South Bohemia is located in the south of the Czech Republic, and shares its border 
                                with both Germany and Austria. Its largest town is Ceske Budejovice, but the best 
                                known one is Cesky Krumlov. So let’s start this tour of fairy tale castles around 
                                South Bohemia with the most famous one.
